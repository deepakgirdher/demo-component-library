<h2>Adventure UI Library</h2>
The Atomic design approach is being taken to develop an efficient and a scalable component library. As per this methodology we will be breaking down the library in following different levels:
<ul>
<li><b>Atoms : </b> Basic individual components like colors, labels and icons are defined as atoms.</li>
<li><b>Molecules : </b>  Atom components are then combined to form molecules such as buttons,input boxes etc. </li>
<li><b>Organisms : </b>  Assembling molecules into more complex units results in organisms, like a header or a card component.</li>
</ul>
<div><img style={{"width":"80%", "marginBottom":"30px"}} src={atom}/></div>

 By embracing Atomic Design principles, our React component library will become highly modular, encouraging code reusability and maintaining a consistent and cohesive design language across the application, ultimately streamlining the development process and enhancing the user experience.
